Roster Workshop
	by Lefteris "Leftos" Aslanoglou


Quick Notes
	Continuing on the Roster Merge & Repair project, comes Roster Workshop. Roster Workshop allows you to merge two or more rosters and get the best out of them. It can automatically match players between rosters and copy over any information you choose. It can also copy team rosters from one roster to another, copying over any missing players (both on team rosters and free agents).
	
	This tool works in combination with REditor, as it doesn't edit any rosters directly, but rather edits the CSVs that REditor can export to and import from. Note that any changes affecting REditor tabs other than just the Players one requires the proper REditor license; otherwise, the changes will not be applied.

Requirements
	This tool requires REDitor v[insert version here] or later. In other words, it is not compatible with REDitor II or older versions.
		
Usage Scenario Examples
	- You have two rosters, one that has the latest rosters and transfers and players, and an older one that, however, has more detailed information for the same players (such as signature shots, accurate gear, ratings and tendencies, etc). You can user Roster Merge & Repair to copy over any information you want from your older roster to the new one, keeping the roster otherwise intact, but also having the updated player attributes.
	- You've already started an Association but there's a new roster that has great tendencies for players or accurate gear, and you don't want to restart the Association just for those changes. You can use Roster Merge & Repair to update the players without messing up anything else, just like the previous scenario.
	- Pretty much anything else you can imagine!

Warning
	Some categories of player information are more dangerous than others. For example, if you select for the Status category to be copied over, but you don't copy Team Rosters, this will end up in a messed up roster, as you need both the Status category and the Team Rosters to be updated for a player to be properly moved to another team.

Disclaimer
	Always keep backups of your rosters. I take no responsibility if this tool messes up your roster and you haven't kept a backup.
